AI has many terms among which Neural Network is used frequently. Neural Network are found in our brain as well. We used the biology of our brain to construct ANN.

Neurons inside Human Brain

Let’s consider our brain recognises some faces on first day of job and on the other day it recognises same faces but as these faces might have changed expression or facial appearance, accuracy would be less than 100%. Our brain has neurons which takes the input and axions inside it learns about it slowly and sends the output to dendrites and someday it is able to detect faces accurately.

Neurons inside ANN

Similarly, in AI, Neural networks are formed which take the input consist of some weights is feeded to some function(sigmoid function) which processes the input along with weights and outputs the result.
