Using java we can learn Object oriented programming structure(OOPS) very fluently

Every object oriented programming has four paradigms:

1.  Encapsulation: It simply means putting all the data/functions altogether in one place as we do when we define classes.
2.  Abstraction: It means we only care about input or output and we do not care about implementation. There is advantage here if we want to optimise our code, we can do without knowledge of user.
3.  Inheritance: It means that if we require to define a class which has common features we can simply inherit from parent class.
4.  Polymorphism: The function of object which we initialized is to be invoked at run time.
